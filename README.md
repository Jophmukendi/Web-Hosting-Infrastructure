# Cloud Web Hosting Platform on AWS

A production-ready cloud infrastructure built on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** for hosting multiple web applications using Docker containers. The platform combines AWS networking, Linux system administration, containerization, and modern web technologies to provide a scalable, secure, and maintainable hosting environment.

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a complete cloud-based web hosting platform capable of hosting multiple PHP and Django applications behind a single Nginx reverse proxy.

The infrastructure follows a layered architecture:

- **Cloud Infrastructure** provisions the networking and compute resources using AWS.
- **Linux Server Configuration** prepares the Ubuntu server and Docker environment.
- **GitHub Deployment** provides version control and a deployment workflow for application updates.
